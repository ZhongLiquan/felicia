# Deer Related Crash Prediction
Deer–vehicle collisions (DVCs) are a persistent safety and economic concern in Pennsylvania, yet quantitative tools for identifying high-risk locations at the road-segment scale remain limited. This study develops a Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling framework for DVCs on state-maintained roads, using PennDOT Public Crash Data linked to the State Road Segment (RMSSEG) inventory. Police- and driver-reported crashes from 2018–2024 were geocoded and matched to homogeneous state road segments, then aggregated to segment–quarter counts. 

## Description of data
This study relies on publicly available crash data published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) annually through its Public Crash Data portal. The dataset spans the years 2018 through 2024 will be used for analysis. The primary datasets include PennDOT's Public Crash Data [1], the State Road Segment dataset (RMSSEG) [2].

The crash records are compiled from three primary sources: Police-Reported Crash Reports, Driver-Reported Crash Reports (Form AA-600) and Calculated and Derived Fields from CDART. The majority of crash data comes from standardized crash reports submitted to PennDOT by law enforcement agencies across the state. Police officers investigating a crash complete detailed records using the state-standard reporting protocol. These reports capture comprehensive information, including crash location, vehicle movements, environmental conditions, and observed contributing factors such as speeding or animal presence (e.g., deer). For minor crashes not investigated by police, Pennsylvania drivers can submit self-reported crash information using Form AA-600, also known as the Driver’s Accident Report form. These entries supplement police reports but are less detailed and not used when police documentation is already available. PennDOT maintains a centralized database known as the Crash Data Analysis and Retrieval Tool (CDART). This system aggregates raw reports from police and drivers, applies data validation rules, and computes additional derived variables. These derived fields may include time-of-day categorization, severity classifications, and spatial attributes (e.g., county and district codes), ensuring consistency across the dataset. Only non-sensitive variables are included in the Public Crash Data Files, which are structured into eight normalized CSV tables. For this study, three key tables were utilized: CRASH and FLAG. These are linked using the Crash Record Number (CRN), a unique identifier assigned to each crash event. 

State Roads Segment Data (RMSSEG) [2]  was obtained from the PennShare Open Data Portal. dataset provides the official segmentation of Pennsylvania's state-maintained roadway network, derived from PennDOT’s Roadway Management System (RMS). Each line segment includes route details, segment identifiers, and attributes such as: County, District, Route Number, Segment & Offset, Functional Class, Number of Lanes, Speed Limit, Urban/Rural designation, Median Type, Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) values and Spatial geometry for mapping in GIS. 

## Research Abstract
Segment-level covariates included total paved width, lane count, an ordinal urban–rural classification, and annual average daily traffic (AADT), which entered the model as an exposure offset. Exploratory analysis showed that DVCs are rare and highly zero-inflated at the segment–quarter level, exhibit a stable seasonal pattern with peaks in the fourth quarter, and increase monotonically with traffic volume. We modeled DVC counts Y_iq using negative binomial (NB) mixed-effects models with a shared log-linear predictor incorporating BYM2 spatial random components, a first-order temporal random walk, and an optional quarterly seasonal component. Model estimation utilized INLA, with performance assessed through DIC, WAIC, mean absolute deviance, and mean squared prediction error metrics. The NB specification including quarterly seasonality significantly outperformed an equivalent model lacking seasonal terms, while coefficient estimates for fixed effects showed consistency across models. The NB size parameter indicated strong overdispersion, and the BYM2 mixing parameter suggested that roughly 90% of residual spatial variance is structured along the segment adjacency graph. Comparison of empirical and model-based zero proportions showed that the NB model with spatiotemporal random effects adequately reproduced the extreme sparsity, making a zero-inflated NB specification unnecessary. Out-of-sample validation for 2024 demonstrated low bias and good predictive performance, and risk stratification revealed that a small fraction of highway corridors accounts for a disproportionate share of observed DVCs. The proposed framework provides a practical tool for generating seasonal DVC risk maps and prioritizing corridor-level mitigation measures such as wildlife fencing, crossing structures, and targeted speed management.
